# GCode Visualization

A small tool to print out and browse GCode files,
because I am not sure why my Cura 4.8 slicer is different than the
Cura 5.1 results, and I want to inspect and learn more about the Marlin
dialect of GCode.

It parses the Markdown files for the Marlin documentation,
and annotates the GCode file with them.
